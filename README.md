The [Remote Bingo](https://rseng.github.io/remote-bingo/) project 
is intended to provide a fun way to play Bingo (either on your own or with others).
The interface will cache your current board, allow for export, and customizing
the items via the [remote-bingo.csv](remote-bingo.csv) file.

**under development**

Remaining to do:

 - get indexing for bingos (rows, columns, diagonals) working
 - add support for local storage (to cache state)
 - test adding new items
 - add color selector in bottom right
